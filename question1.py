# Points: 8
# Write a Python program that calculates movie ticket costs with different pricing.
# Requirements:
# Ask the user for their name and age
# Set ticket prices: 
# Child (under 13): $8
# Adult(13âˆ’64):$12
# Senior (65+): $9
# Ask how many tickets they want (Ticket prices should be calculated based on the age of the person buying them)
# Calculate total cost and display a receipt-style output
# Use f-string formatting for the receipt
# Create file: question1.py

age = int(input("What is your age?\n "))
